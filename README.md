- 👋 Hi, I’m @foyojhumel and I'm a Mechanical Engineer experienced in maintenance field. I have discovered data analysis in my line of work where data driven decision making are needed
to improve machine and production efficiency. Everyday production data collection, cleaning, transforming, analyzation, and visualization using Microsoft Excel are some of my responsibilities.
When I was learning more about data analysis to improve my skills, I had discovered Python, the main programming language being used for data science, and from there I had learn more about the
world of programming.
- 👀 I’m interested and working on my skills to shift my career into the technology industry as a data engineer or developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data engineering and computer science basic courses with DataCamp and Harvard University online courses. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects just guide me in the start and I will work hard to contribute immediately.
